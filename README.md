# taskli
Another CLI for TaskWarrior

## Why another CLI for TaskWarrior?

I'm using `tasksh` since two weeks but want to add some functionnalities that
I don't figure out how to do it with it like add tasks containing chars
that need escaping in shell, make the propnt sensible to the context, use a
project as a context...

## Why `taskli`

`taskli` states for `TaskWarrior` `CLI`.

## Why `Python`

I choose Python just because I want to enhance my skill in Python.

On the other hand, I think Python is a good choice if I want other people
extend my work. It should be easy to extend `taskli` by subclassing the
`Taskli` class.
